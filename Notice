International Clown Festival Make-up Competition
 
Clowns have been known and loved for thousands of years all over the world. 
The Most famous and well known clowns we know from movies and TV; Mr. Bean, Jackie Chan, Charlie Chaplin, Ronald McDonald 
They make us laugh, release stress, and speak eaasily of things that are difficult. 
They are often praised for their ability to communicate truthfully. 
Some clowns can communicate without talking, making them true global citizens.
This year, we want to celebrate clowns from around the world. 
We want our students to learn from each other and teach their teachers about clowns from their own country.
We want our students to learn to tell a story with their actions and expressions. 
We want to see your skills for clown make-up and clothing, and we want you to make us laugh. 

We invite a parent to join their child on October 31st to celebrate clowns.
If it is not possible for you to attend, you can still help your child to come to school with clown make up.
If your child can not dress as a clown for the event, they can still come and enjoy the games.

There will prizes the clowns announced following the party and presented on speech day.
The clown make-up will be judged on quality of make-up application (ie. smooth coverage and nice crisp lines) and originality.
